# Doug's Video Player

I wanted a simple always-on-top video player that would automatically move out
of the way when the mouse approached it. This player uses VLC to play a video, and 
it will automatically move to a corner of the screen. Hold down the Shift key 
and you will be able to move the mouse over the video player window.

The player also responds to some keystrokes, but ONLY while the app is focused.
